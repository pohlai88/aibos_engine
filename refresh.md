# REFRESH/DEBUG REQUEST

## 1. What’s the problem?
(Describe the error, bug, or unexpected behavior. Include error messages, screenshots, or logs if possible.)

## 2. What have you tried so far?
- List steps already taken (restarts, code changes, etc.)
- Note any files or areas already checked

## 3. What should the AI do now?
- Re-examine the entire codebase, not just the files already viewed
- Check for type mismatches, missing imports, or outdated references
- Look for related issues in other modules or shared types
- Suggest a systematic fix, not just a patch

## 4. After the fix:
- Re-run all relevant tests and builds
- Confirm the error is resolved and no new issues are introduced
- Update documentation or ROADMAP.md if the fix affects features or workflow

**Use this template when stuck, when errors persist, or when the AI seems “stuck” on the wrong files.**
